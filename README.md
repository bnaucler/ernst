# ernst v0.1A
A very unfriendly (Swedish-speaking) IRC bot.

## Written by
B Naucler (mail@bnaucler.se)

## Usage
Channel, nickname, server etc is hardcoded in the .go file. Edit and run. That's it. You only need ernst.go and ernst.db to run. Additional files are helper programs for dumping and creating databases.

## Thanks to
Thomas Jager (for go-ircevent)
